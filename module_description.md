This module requires the [sql server integration](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/sqlserver/?tab=host) to be configured.
It has basic SQL Server monitoring. Locks, process blocked, connectivity.
It's best to also use Datadog's APM instrumentation to understand the way the application is using the database.
There's an upcoming feature in Datadog to fully support deep dive database monitoring.
